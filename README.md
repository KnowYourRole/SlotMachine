# SlotMachine
Slot machine c++ 


This program emulates a virtual slot machine game, where a grid filled with different fruits is randomly generated. The objective is to discover specific patterns of consecutive fruits within rows, each with its own point value. For example, cherries might be worth 5 points, while grapes could be worth 180 points. The program meticulously examines each row of the grid, identifying and rewarding players for finding these winning combinations. It then displays the winning fruit, the corresponding points earned, and the number of consecutive fruits in the sequence. At the end of the game, the program calculates and reveals the total points won, or, in the absence of winning combinations, encourages the player to try their luck again in the next round.
